SKVATT, Installation
----------------------------------------

Add the following lines to the file .sicstusrc (creating the file if necessary):

	:- multifile library_directory/1, file_search_path/2.
	library_directory('/users/me/my_programs/skvatt/src').
	file_search_path(skvatt, '/users/me/my_programs/skvatt/src').

(assuming that the Skvatt Prolog files are located in the specified directory).            


Using SKVATT together with Thistle
----------------------------------------

It is possible to use Thistle to look at the parsetrees.
(Or at least it was possible back in 2004):

Install Thistle from ftp://ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/thistle 
Make sure it is possible to run from the command line under 
the name 'thistle'.
