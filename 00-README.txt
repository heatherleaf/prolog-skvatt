SKVATT, by Peter Ljunglöf
-----------------------------

SKVATT is an addition to Sicstus Prolog to get feature structures
and efficient unification based parsing and generation.
It has developed from PLATT, which in turn was inspired by
PRATTLE by Mark Johnson. The code is completely new however.

It is similar to GULP by Michael Covington, but with another syntax.
