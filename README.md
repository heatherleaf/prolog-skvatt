# prolog-skvatt

SKVATT is an addition to Sicstus Prolog to get feature structures and efficient unification based parsing and generation. It has developed from PLATT, which in turn was inspired by PRATTLE by Mark Johnson. The code is completely new however.

It is very similar to GULP by Michael Covington, but with another syntax. See <http://www.ai.uga.edu/mc/gulp/> for more information about GULP.

**Note 1**: This is a programming library! At least some knowledge of Prolog is required to be able to use it.

**Note 1**: This code has not been changed since 2004, I do not guarantee that it still works!

**Note 2**: It only works on Sicstus Prolog 3.
